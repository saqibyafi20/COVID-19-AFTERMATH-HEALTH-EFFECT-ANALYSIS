- 500 patient records<br>
- Features include age, gender, severity, hospitalization status,<br>
  recovery days, fatigue level, and long COVID risk.<br>

- Power BI (optional – visualization stage)<br>

## Key Business Questions
- What is the average recovery duration after COVID?<br>
- Does hospitalization increase recovery time?<br>
- Which patients experienced the longest recovery?<br>
- How does severity relate to long COVID risk?<br>

## Key Insights
